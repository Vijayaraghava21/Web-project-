In today’s fast-paced global economy, businesses face challenges in managing supply 

chains efficiently. Issues such as demand forecasting inaccuracies, inventory 

mismanagement, supplier delays, and logistical inefficiencies lead to increased costs and 

reduced customer satisfaction. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in particular, 

struggle with limited access to advanced supply chain analytics, making it difficult to 

compete with larger corporations. 

The problem Is how to provide real-time, data-driven insights to optimize supply chain 

operations without replacing human decision-makers but enhancing their ability to make 

informed choices. 

TARGET AUDIENCE:

- SMEs lacking advanced supply chain tools 

- Logistics managers in need of predictive analytics 

- Procurement teams seeking supplier performance insights 

- Retailers struggling with inventory optimization
